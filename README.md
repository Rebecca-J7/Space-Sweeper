# Space-Sweeper
Cutie Hackathon 2024 Entry

# Inspiration
Space Junk - unused or forgotten satellite modules in space still orbiting Earth
Accumulation of space junk potentially leads to cascading collisions
Collision with space debris causes damage to operation satellites, posing a risk to spacecraft and astronauts

# What Our Project Does
Scans for the nearest object /trash
Travels towards that trash while continuously scanning for more trash/objects
Sweeps up the object/trash
Mission Accomplished! We made more space in space!

# Why It is Important
The module will help identify and remove masses of space junk
Helps reduce the Kessler Syndrome - where the chain of reaction collisions in earthâ€™s orbit creates space debris that makes orbit unusable
Similar implementation could be done to tackle waste build-up on earth

# How We Built It
Arduino Kit
Arduino IDE
Cardboard, tape, straws

# Challenges we ran into
Getting the motion sensor and motor to work at the same time
Figuring out how to turn the vehicle
Assembling the module: how to move and balance the vehicle with only one motor

# Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Implemented code to have the motion sensor and motor to work fluidly w/o hindrances
Implemented code to have the module detect the closest object and steer towards it
Created components/parts of the module from scratch (cardboard, tape, straws, etc.)

# What we learned
The different pros and cons of different motors: we had to choose wisely which motor to use for different functions
Being efficient with our motors (1 for straight movement, 1 for detecting direction changes)
Our first time creating a sensor-driven vehicle with Arduino!

# What's next for Space Sweeper
Implement GPS to track the positions of objects/junk
Figure how this would transfer to a floating/flying component
