# Space-Sweeper
Cutie Hackathon 2024 Entry <br/>
By: Allison Lee, Anoushka Limaye, Zehua Bao & Rebecca Jennings

# Inspiration
Space Junk - unused or forgotten satellite modules in space still orbiting Earth <br/>
Accumulation of space junk potentially leads to cascading collisions <br/>
Collision with space debris causes damage to operation satellites, posing a risk to spacecraft and astronauts <br/>

# Why It is Important
The module will help identify and remove masses of space junk <br/>
Helps reduce the Kessler Syndrome - where the chain of reaction collisions in earthâ€™s orbit creates space debris that makes orbit unusable <br/>
Similar implementation could be done to tackle waste build-up on earth <br/>

# What Our Project Does
Scans for the nearest object /trash <br/>
Travels towards that trash while continuously scanning for more trash/objects <br/>
Sweeps up the object/trash <br/>
Mission Accomplished! We made more space in space! <br/>

# How We Built It
Arduino Kit <br/>
Arduino IDE <br/>
Cardboard, tape, straws <br/>

# Challenges we ran into
Getting the motion sensor and motor to work at the same time <br/>
Figuring out how to turn the vehicle <br/>
Assembling the module: how to move and balance the vehicle with only one motor <br/>

# Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Implemented code to have the motion sensor and motor to work fluidly w/o hindrances <br/>
Implemented code to have the module detect the closest object and steer towards it <br/>
Created components/parts of the module from scratch (cardboard, tape, straws, etc.) <br/>

# What we learned
The different pros and cons of different motors: we had to choose wisely which motor to use for other functions <br/>
Being efficient with our motors (1 for straight movement, 1 for detecting direction changes) <br/>
Our first time creating a sensor-driven vehicle with Arduino! <br/>

# What's next for Space Sweeper
Implement GPS to track the positions of objects/junk <br/>
Figure how this would transfer to a floating/flying component <br/>
